# systemverilog_in_vivado
Just a little place to practice systemverilog in vivado. There is nothing to see here.

## struct_test
I just wanted to see how verilog structures are handled in the Vivado simulator and in the Vivado hardware debugger (ILA).  Both tools display the structures in a nice organized way.
